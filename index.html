      <p>I was born in Davao City, Philippines. When I was 5 years old, I moved to Lilburn, GA and a few years later moved to Lawrenceville, GA. 
          I now currently reside in Kennesaw, GA with my cat. I live by myself, but I love the peace and quiet.
        </p>
        <p>I graduated from Southern Polytechnic State University in May 2015 with my Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering Technology with a minor in Business Administration. 
        Along with my degrees, I also received my certification for Green Belt Six Sigma. 
        Upon gradution, I started working as an accountant for a large dealership. I worked there for a little over a year. 
        I was unhappy with my job, so I went on to pursue a career in Engineering, my first love. 
        Soon after this realization, I accepted a position at Jefferson Southern Corporation in Rockmart, GA as their Quality Engineer.

        <p>
        My life is very consumed with work, as I am a very career oriented person. I have an amazing life otuside of work. 
        I am your stereotypical girl, brunches on Sundays, shopping on the weekends, wine nights, and girl talk for hours at a time. 
        I am a huge cat lover, as I currently have one. She is my fur child that's 14 years old. 
        She's a little grumpy, but once she warms up to you, she is the biggest cupcake ever.
